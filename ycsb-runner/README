#### HERDDB BENCHMARK ####

#edit herdb.properties if you need to change the configuration for the connection
#herd.properties MUST BE IN THE EXECUTION FOLDER
#example of herd.properties/*
        db.driver=herddb.jdbc.Driver
        db.url=jdbc:herddb:server:127.0.0.1:7000
        db.user="User name"
        db.passwd= "yourUserPass"
        */
#execute this command
#JAVA_HOME=/your/java/path ./ycsb-report.sh  YCSB_PATH    HERDDB_PATH  NUMBER_OF_ATTEMPTS   LIST_OF_WORKLOAD
#the result is saved in target/HERDDB_Benchmark-yyyy-mm-dd-HH-MM-SS.log


#### MYSQL BENCHMARK ####

prerequisites: 
 *MYSQL must be running
 *DB USER have all privileges 

#create mysql.properties
#example of mysql.properties/*
	db.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
	db.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3307/usertabledata
	db.user="Db User name"
	db.passwd="Your user Passwd"
	*/
#execute this command

#the result is saved in target/MYSQL_Benchmark-yyyy-mm-dd-HH-MM-SS.log



#### BENCHMARK IN CLUSTER MODE ####

#create cluster.properties
#example of cluster.properties/*
	db.driver=herddb.jdbc.Driver
	db.url=jdbc:herddb:zookeeper:localhost:2181
	db.user=sa
	db.passwd=hdb
	*/

#the result is saved in target/HERDDB_Benchmark-yyyy-mm-dd-HH-MM-SS.log

#### METRICS #### 

during the bench the metrics are automatically downloaded.
the results are saved in the "target/metrics" folder.
the load and run phase metrics are present.

if you have done more "benchmark" of the same workload, the metrics of that workload are numbered
increasingly, so the file with the largest number is the last one
metrics downloaded.

file format= workloadName_(run/load)_metrics.number.log
